# Updates to Environment Setup

In the `conda create` remove `dvc`

# Updates to rubric

Under "git and dvc" remove the entire second row "Set up dvc and track files". Fortunately, the rubric makes no mention to AWS!

# Updates to project instructions

* Under repositories change the first bullet and sub-bullet to: "Create a directory for the project and initialize Git." and "As you work on the code, continually commit changes. Trained models you want to use in production must be committed to GitHub."
* Remove all of "Set up S3"
* Remove the last two bullets under "GitHub Actions" (since we're not using DVC or AWS anymore).
* Under "Data" remove the two bullets that reference DVC.
* Under "API Deployment" remove the two bullets reference AWS and DVC.
