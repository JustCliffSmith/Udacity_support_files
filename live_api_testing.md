# Trying out live APIs

A fun way to get experience with the `requests` module is to query a live API! There is an extensive list of free and public APIs [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). Many of these do not even require an authorization key, though getting access to one that needs a key is also good practice! 

Note that not all APIs are created equally and some have way significantly more documentation than others. For instance the Art Institute of Chicago's API has extensive [documentation](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#website-2). Some APIs even have their documentation using Swagger like you saw with FastAPI!
